    <h1>Hello There!</h1>
    <h2>Thank you so much for visiting my site!</h2>
    <h3>This site is ideal for users who want to avoid certain ingredients or those seeking products with ingredients that may be beneficial for their skin.
        <br>
      I started this project because I believe it's important for consumers to understand the ingredients in their makeup products. I took the initiative to tackle this labor-intensive task, making it easier for users to find and explore product ingredients.
      Since I built the database from scratch, I am continually adding new makeup brands and ingredients, with plans to regularly update and expand it with additional features. 
      <br><br>
      Hope to see you soon!</h3> <br><br><br>
